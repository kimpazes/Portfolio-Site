        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Cooking and nutrition has been more and more a debated thematic nowadays. The problem is to try to include it in the
          different routine that everyone has.</p>
        <p>Nata is an app that adapts the user needs at the moment by filtering different cathegories, it can be that you just want
          to cook something fast from lack of time, based by the money that you have available or some specific ingredient/type
          of diet that you want to discover.</p>

        <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
        <p>A competitive analysis of the main competitors in the market was conducted. Looking for the most used cooking apps, I
          chose “Kitchen Stories” and “Yummly” to conduct the analysis. It was quite long so I will present just the main parts of
          “Kitchen Stories”.</p>
        <h3>Kitchen Stories</h3>
        <h4>Key Objectives</h4>
        <p>It is an app that is free and open to everyone. Their core message is that “everyone can cook”, being that their slogan.
          Every type of recipe can be found in this app, from vegetarian to low carb, options for every lifestyle. What sets them
          from the competitors apart is that they inspire you to upload your own recipes, make your own community and share
          your experiences showing that everyone can do it.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>This app encourages every type of people to start cooking</li>
          <li>Incentives you to upload and share your experience in the kitchen with an international crowd</li>
          <li>Access to a very big amount of free recipes, tips, videos and articles daily</li>
          <li>Brings together an huge community worldwide through the exchange of information</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="row">
          <h4>Swot Analysis</h4>

            <div class="row">
              <div class="column">
                <h5>Strenghts</h5>
                <ul>
                  <li>Attractive, simple and award winning UI design</li>
                  <li>Provides food articles and inspiration stories</li>
                  <li>Gives the option to create, upload and comment
                    recipes</li>
                  <li>Gives you the option to make your own cooking

                <h5>Weaknesses</h5>
                <ul>
                  <li>Lack of marketing for the app in general</li>
                  <li>Not having the filters right away to choose
                    what exactly you are looking for</li>
                  <li>Not having in the filters the difficulty level or
                    the costs of the meal, it is also a factor that is
                    important</li>

                <ul>
                  <li>Put the filters in the first page making the search
                    easier and more intuitive</li>
                  <li>Include the diculty level available as a filter so
                    that you can choose what you want to do and how
                    dificult it should be</li>
                  <li>Include the price range for the meal as a filter to
                    give the opportunity to fit everyone needs, ex: a
                    student hasn’t the same money budget as an
                    employed person</li>

                <h5>Threats</h5>
                <ul>
                  <li>A lot of similar apps and websites with similar
                    content and have the same target</li>
                  <li>More focused to the user</li>

        <h2>User interviews</h2>
        <p>The first step to create this app was to conduct research to figure out the key features that my app would need to fullfil the best way the goals proposed. For that I recruited potential users to interview and created a set of non-leading
          questions to undertand theys piont of view and wishes in order to create the user personas.</p>

            <ul>

              <li>The love for cooking but the lack of time to do it is a problem</li>
              <li>Be able to select the ingredients that you have available at the moment so that trips to the supermarket can be avoided</li>
              <li>Appealing images are important</li>
              <li>Rattings from other users are important</li>
              <li>Save the recipes into cathegories is a nice tool to have</li>
